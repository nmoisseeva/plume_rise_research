A. Convective PBL:

1) Create a WRF-fire LES domain that has two parallel mountain ridges running across the whole model.  Use cyclic lateral boundary conditions.

  a) Run WRF-fire in LES mode with no fire, but with zero imposed geostrophic wind, and with "sunshine" turned on to create surface heating and a convective mixed layer.   

Describe the interaction between the growing convective mixed layer and cross-valley anabatic circulations.  Describe how the PBL top varies in height and strength (delta theta) across the mountain ranges, and how TKE varies across the mountain ranges.  

  b) Repeat with light synoptic-scale imposed winds across the mountains, and (3m/s)

  c) again for moderate winds across the mountains (6 m/s), and describe the changes to the PBL.


2) Re-do (1abc), but with a fire on one of the mountain slopes that faces your central valley.  

Describe the changes to the PBL.


3) If a medium-resolution WRF were run using a PBL parameterization, which PBL parameterization would best describe:
  a) the PBL far away from the fire, as found from your LES runs.
  b) close to, or above, the fire, as found from your LES runs.


B. Stable PBL. 

   Same as (A), but for nighttime with radiative cooling of the land surface.
